## About
Backend-focused .NET developer building **production-style** services in **C#/.NET** with a strong interest in
**cloud (AWS)**, **containerized deployments**, and **observability**.

I like turning “learning projects” into realistic systems: microservice-style boundaries, async messaging,
background jobs, health checks, and deployable environments (local Docker Compose → single-VM EC2 dev setup).
I care about clean architecture, pragmatic tradeoffs, and shipping.
